### scala.meta

Metaprogramming API and host interfaces of [scala.meta](http://scalameta.org) aka the successor of `scala.reflect` designed to be simple, robust and portable. Take a look at [Trees.scala](/scalameta/src/main/scala/scala/meta/Trees.scala) to learn about core data structures and at [semantic](/scalameta/src/main/scala/scala/meta/semantic) to get acquainted with core semantic APIs. Host implementors, visit [hosts.md](/docs/hosts.md).

#### How to use

The project is in an early stage, so it's not supposed to be immediately useful just yet. However, if you're brave enough, we have a nightly build that publishes artifacts to Sonatype at `"org.scalameta" % "scalameta_2.11" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"`.
