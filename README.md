### Dottyhost

Dottyhost provides implementations of scalameta/scalameta [contexts](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/blob/master/scalameta/src/main/scala/scala/meta/semantic/Context.scala) for compile-time and runtime metaprogramming with [scala.meta](http://scalameta.org). The implementations are based on [dotc](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty) compiler internals.

### How to use

This project has been created just a few days ago, so it's not supposed to be immediately usable by anyone, even by the authors.
